<li> People who want to understand Python OOP through a real life example, </li>
<li> People who need to build data around Porsche model for a markeplace.</li>
</ul>

<li> Cayenne </li>
</ul>

<h2> Getting started on Porsche modelisation </h2>

<h3>Reproducing the structure vs cloning</h3>

<p> You can choose to recreate the directory and then copy paste the content of each files. Or you can clone this project directory.</p>

<h4> Reproducing the structure </h4>

<p> Create your directory and move into it:</p>

```
mkdir porsche
cd porsche
```

<h4> Cloning this github project </h4>

<p> In order to clone this project, you will need git on your computer. To make sure you have git, enter the following command:</p>

```
git --version
```

<p> If you do not have git, I encourage you to install it by following the different steps explained on the following webpage: https://git-scm.com/downloads </p>


<h3> Packages </h3>
<p> There is no required packages to install to use the classes. However, if you want to perform the operations in the main.py file, you may need the following packages: </p>
<ul>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>sqlalchemy</li>
<li>numpy</li>
</ul>

<p> Before downloading these packages, I encourage you to create your virtual environment by using the following commands in your terminal.</p>

<p>You can create your virtual environment called "env":</p>

```
python3 -m venv env
```

<p>Finally, you can start installing the mentioned packages. Here is an example of how to install the packages:</p>

```
pip3 install pandas
```

<h3> Using the different classes </h3>

<p>A main.py file has already been added into the project. However, you may want to start from a black python file.</p>

<p>Make sure you are in the Porsche folder where the porsche.py file is. Then create a new python file using the following command:</p>

```
touch project.py
```

<p>Once you have set up the project, here is what you can import the different class from the porsche.py file.</p>
<p>Use the following command: </p>

```
from porsche import Carrera, Targa, Cayman, Boxster, Macan, Cayenne
```

<h2> Creating Porche objects </h2>

<p>TBD.</p>
